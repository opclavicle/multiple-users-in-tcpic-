# multiple-users-in-tcpic
 Multiple users in the same tcpip under Matlab (2012a or later versions)
 Combined with Psychtoobox ; 2 clients (or 3, 4, 5) and 1 server.
 
 You may run server firstly, then run client 1 and client 2.
 
 Just replace the port (number) for 2 different number.
 
 And replace clients' ip XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX from your server computer local ip.
 
 After that just press any key, you would see the yoyo on client 1 and client 2.
 Then you are successful to connect with multiple clients now.
